TSPARMCD,"Trial Summary Parameter Short Name",Char,TSPARMCD,Topic,"TSPARMCD (the companion to TSPARM) is limited to 8 characters and does not have special character restrictions. These values should be short for ease of use in programming, but it is not expected that TSPARMCD will need to serve as variable names.

TSPARM,"Trial Summary Parameter",Char,TSPARM,"Synonym Qualifier","Term for the trial summary parameter. The value in TSPARM cannot be longer than 40 characters. Examples: 'Planned Minimum Age of Subjects', 'Planned Maximum Age of Subjects'.",Req,See TSPARMCD mapping table in TSPARM_spec.csv,,
TSVAL,"Parameter Value",Char,,"Result Qualifier","Value of TSPARM. Example: 'ASTHMA' when TSPARM value is 'Trial Indication'. TSVAL can only be null when TSVALNF is populated.
